## Ontology:   
_"Technically, We're All Connected: A Profile of 3 Students in STEAM"_

These students all three have involvement in technoloy, whether it is Digital Arts like Valerie,
buiness tech and entrepreneurship, like Lingling/Lily, or engineering like Kevin.
For this reason, I elected to make the STEAM connection between the 3.  There is no rational order, currently, for the order of students or pages. 

## Taxonomy:  

In progress; working on making sure all headings line up appropriately, and that the individual sites are comparable lengths. 

## Choreography:    

Each personal page opens with a header and nav, followed by an image of the student, and then four headings: "About Me", "Early Life and
Education", "Experience", and "Goals". There will be another subheading in the footer titled "Sources". 

There will be links on the index page images to carry through to each person's respective page, as well as the original nav bar, and a "read more" link" 

Once on the individual students' pages, the navigation is relegated to the nav bar at the top.
