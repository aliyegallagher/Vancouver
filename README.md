## Ontology:   
_"Technically, We're All Connected: A Profile of 3 Students in STEAM"_

These students all three have involvement in technoloy, whether it is in Digital Arts like Valerie,
Buiness Technology and Entrepreneurship, like Lingling/Lily, or Engineering like Kevin.
For this reason, I elected to make the STEAM connection between the 3.  There is no rational order, currently, for the order of students or pages. It is the order they were presented when given to us, and seemed as good as any other order. 

## Taxonomy:  

On each of the various pages, I proofread and edited the text to make it more readable for English-speaking audiences. On some pages, I had to cut or rearrange items to make them more consistent with the structure of the headings, and in the case of Valerie's page, I reached out to ask her for info to fill out her "Goals" heading, which she graciously supplied.  

The four headings are titled "About Me", "Early Life and Education", "Experience", and "Goals". For the most part (with some editing and rearranging, of course), most of the info provided by the students fit fairly well into those categories--or at least, they were the categories that made the most sense with the information provided. 

## Choreography:    

Each personal page opens with a header and nav, followed by an image of the student, and then four headings: "About Me", "Early Life and
Education", "Experience", and "Goals". Another subheading in the footer is titled "Sources".  This felt like the most logical progression of the information, as it fulfills the 'profile' structure of the site. The sources are located at the bottom becasue they are not important enough bits of information to be located near the top, but they still belong on the page (and also, we are accustomed to seeeing sources at the end of an article or page). 

The index page is structured a bit differently. Each student has a snippet of their profile page shown, with a "read more" link at the end of the paragraph designed to carry them through seamlessly to the students' respective pages. THe nav bar is also present at the top, so there are multiple ways to move about the site present even on the home page. 

Once on the individual students' pages, the navigation is featured at the top of the page, as well as at the bottom, to facilitate navigation between pages and make it less work for the user, as they won't have to scroll all the way back up the page to locate the site's navigation.
