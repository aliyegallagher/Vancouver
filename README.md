## Ontology:   
_"Technically, We're All Connected: A Profile of 3 Students in STEAM"_

These students all three have involvement in technoloy, whether it is Digital Arts like Valerie,
buiness tech and entrepreneurship, like Lingling/Lily, or engineering like Kevin.
For this reason, I elected to make the STEAM connection between the 3.  

## Taxonomy:  

## Choreography:    

Each personal page opens with a header and nav, followed by an image of the student, and then four headings: "About Me", "Early Life and
Education", "Experience", and "Goals".
