				<span>M</span>y name is Lingling Li and my English name is Lily. I come from Shanghai, China. I love playing the piano, drawing, cooking and playing the badminton. I’m now a sophomore, and also the D’Lion in charge of Gate 6 and Gannett 6. My job is to help the first year student better move in to the brand new college life, and be their first friend in the college. I’m planning to have a double major in Business and Digital Media Study, minor in Japanese. A fun fact of me: I can never counts how many steps I had done when doing the “Running jump shot”

		<p>I’m a sophomore at the University of Rochester majoring in data science with clusters in Chinese and Psychology. I am also the marketing director of the Hong Kong Students’ Association. As the marketing director, I update the club’s social media pages and create posters for events. I was born and raised in New York City. Some of my favorite things to do in New York City include walking around Soho and going to the best bubble tea shops, such as Bar Pa Tea and Yaya Tea. In addition, I consider myself a foodie, always trying the newest restaurant or dessert shop which is why I created a foodstagram to document all of my food journeys.</p>
